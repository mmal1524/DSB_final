## About Me
I'm Mahima Malhotra, an incoming freshman at Purdue University. I'm planning on double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. 

## Sources
The first source was Primer.Data [@primerdata]

The source for the data was the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI) [@CDI] from the CDC, which collected data from numerous organizations.
